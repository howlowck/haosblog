# Code Smells in Javascript and How to refactor them

As a technical evangelist for Microsoft, I read a lot of code.  The quality of code ranges from junior developers to seasoned experts in the field.  Here I will list a few patterns that I've noticed.  These are written in Javascript but probably applies to other languages as well.

## `else` keyword

## Explicit `true` or `false`

## Nested logic branches

## Outer scope variable to handle async
